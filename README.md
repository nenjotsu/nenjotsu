Hey, Iâ€™m Nenjo â€” a software engineer with over a decade of experience building scalable systems, backend architectures, and automation tools that donâ€™t crashâ€¦ most of the time.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building AI-powered automation workflows using LangChain, CrewAI, and vector databases for real-world use cases in trading, productivity, and dev tools.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced prompt engineering techniques, multi-agent orchestration (MCP, LangGraph), and context optimization for large language models.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI-driven SaaS tools, agent-based systems, and open-source projects that explore intelligent task automation.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with scaling AI agents efficiently, using observability tools like Traceloop or PromptLayer, and building context-aware agent ecosystems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about prompt engineering, LangChain, CrewAI, OpenAI function calling, or automating workflows with LLMs and vector DBs.
- ðŸ§  I help traders turn their strategies into fully automated bots using Expert Advisors, Python, or Go. If youâ€™re ready to bring your idea to life, Iâ€™d be happy to help.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once turned a spaghetti-coded script into a full-blown AI agent that now responds more intelligently than the person who wrote the original script.
